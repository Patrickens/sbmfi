    "The folder structure of the package is:\n",

    "sbmfi\n",

    "`core` contains all the algorithms that are necessary to specify a simulator that takes as input fluxes and outputs mass distribution vectors (MDV) of metabolites in a steady-state $^{13}C$ carbon labelling experiment (CLE) using the Elementary Metabolic Unit (EMU) algorithm {cite}`Antoniewicz2007`. The `core` module inherits a lot of its functionality from the [`cobrapy`](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package {cite}`Ebrahim2013` which is useful for manipulating constraint based metabolic models (CBM). **We recommend users to build intimate familiarity with `cobrapy` in order to use `sbmfi`** since a simulator in this context consists of a CBM that is decorated with labelling information for a subset of reactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "`priors` contains different algorithms to sample from priors that incorporate various biological assumptions. `inference` contains algorithms for Markov Chain Monte-Carlo and Sequential Monte-Carlo methods for sampling posterior distributions given $^{13}C$ labelling measurements. It also contains some convenience methods to build normalizing flow models that can be used for simulation based inference {cite}`Antoniewicz2007`. The `models` folder contains the inputs necessary to specify CBMs and to decorate them with labelling information. Lastly, `compound` defines some basic manipulations of chemical formulas. Its functionality is useful when simulating mass-spectrometry data. \n",
