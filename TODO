Thermodynamic sampling:
    Make setting reaction energies and sampling fluxes as fast as possible DONE


Polytope transforms:
    get polytope in vertex representation -> compute barycentric coordintates
        use softmax function, since this is a convex combination over output variables (like required for vertex representation)
        transform to log-ratio space and use normal MCMC to sample in unconstrained space

Compositional analysis
    Make the observation model play out on the simplex by transforming to ALR
    Test differen log ratio transforms (LR) and neural net convergence (I would guess ILR would work best)

Net, exchange uniform sampling:
    Sample net fluxes uniformely and sample exchange fluxes uniformely DONE
    calculate PSRF for net/xch fluxes or fwd/rev fluxes

Msc student project [pending Nicola]:
    Write proposal on pyruvate, succinate and combination

Incorporate uncertainty in biomass reaction by sampling coefficients (kind of like ratios)

Observation model:
    Multi-variate normal intensities
    Normalizing flow with 4 covarying values in decreasing order of intensity
    Deal with missing signals
    Figure out whether bias is a thing in LC-MS

Normalizing flow optimization: normalizing flow allow for evaluation of exact likelihood and computation of derivatives.
    this means we can locally optimize! L^max = max( L(theta / v) = NF(x^obs) ): maximum likelhihood!

Experiment design:
    Fix this with ConstantAdditiveGaussianMDVErrors
    Design for Succinate, Pyruvate, Succinate+Pyruvate (Xylose, Glycerol...)

Measurement model:
    Do Alaa method with own samples
    Test code with Covid model

Posterior bleeding:
    Idea 1: penalize likelihood by euclidian distance from polytope
    Idea 2: transform every point in polytope to barycentric coordinates that lie on simplex
        (requires computing all vertices of the polytope) and tranform simplectic coordinates to real coordinates
        Do conditional density estimation in the real coordinates and transform back topolytope guaranteeing support.

    I want to move to US (pref SF, maybe Boston) how is it?
    Prolly for post-doc in a space that could lead to startup

Include in paper:
    Discussion of MFA in microbial communities, mammalian cells and complex media NEED incorporation of prior info
    Highlight that many screens in sys-bio have a high false discovery rate
    Compare inference on an out of distribution sample between normalizing flow network and 13CFLUX2


Experimental design:
    READ: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0037549703040937
    Use framework from: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888
    Since we have a normalizing flow, this problem is much easier, since we can more easily estimate evidence P(X)
    Write arXiv paper on this approach?
